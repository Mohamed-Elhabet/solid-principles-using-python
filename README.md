# SOLID Principles in Python

### This repository contains examples of the SOLID principles in Python, showcasing both correct implementations and common violations. The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines that help developers create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. Each principle is illustrated with code examples that demonstrate how to adhere to and how to violate these principles.

---------------------------------------------------------

## Repository Structure
### The repository is organized into the following files, each representing one of the SOLID principles:

```
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

s.py: Demonstrates a correct implementation adhering to the SRP.
s-violate.py: Shows a violation of the SRP.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

o.py: Demonstrates a correct implementation adhering to the OCP.
o-violate.py: Shows a violation of the OCP.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

l.py: Demonstrates a correct implementation adhering to the LSP.
l-violate.py: Shows a violation of the LSP.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

i.py: Demonstrates a correct implementation adhering to the ISP.
i-violate.py: Shows a violation of the ISP.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

d.py: Demonstrates a correct implementation adhering to the DIP.
d-violate.py: Shows a violation of the DIP.
```
